                <p>
                    Customers can connect to agents directly by a keypress or at specific points in the IVR. You can assign agents in IVR or per campaign.

                    Define actions for outbound voice campaign when calls are picked by answering machines. Numbers can be unsubscribed or you may like to drop a message before hanging up.

                <p>
                    Speech recognition is a very powerful tool in parsing user response. It makes the IVR interactions more friendly and easier to engage in.
                    This especially comes handy for agencies enrolling people to their packages.

                <p>
                    Voice campaigns can be outbound and inbound. For outbound campaigns, you create it with a list, along with time boundary for when to run and finish by.
                    Campaigns can be paused or stopped anytime while running.

					You can seperate users in groups with different permission levels.
                    At default, two user levels are implemented. Backoffice staff or team members and managers. 
                    Managers can be authorized special permissions while staffs look over operations and monitoring.
                    There is a superadmin for complete authority over authorization and others.

                <p>
                    Credits are consumed against transfer ie. call connect with agents. 
                    A fixed number of credits allocated by admin for a time period. After exhaust of the credits, any
                    running campaigns are paused automatically and remains until next recharge. 
                    This is designed to protect over expenditure for very big campaigns.

                    The system can be deployed in containerized environments like Docker, Heroku/Dokku, Kubernetes, Linux container(LXC) etc.
                    Container based isolation helps in better utilization in small to medium scale workloads and migrations.

                    Call rates are controlled by the transport provider and also depends on available server resource. 
                    We have iterated over tons worker optimizations for efficient resource handling. We have component decoupling strategies to cope for medium to high load scenerio.
